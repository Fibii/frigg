Let's cut straight to the chase. You're either here as a technical Partner manager, wondering if Frigg can help your product team deliver integrations faster, with higher quality, and cheaper. Or you're here as a technical lead for your product (CTO, CPO, Product leader, engineer, etc.) and evaluating whether this framework is worth hitching your wagon to.

We're still early days, so you'll want to come back here often. But let's dive in.

What is Frigg?

The Frigg Framework is an opinionated integration framework built with modern software development teams in mind. The aim of the framework is to have you up and running out of the box with a flexible set of tools to help rapidly add integrations to your software that your end users can manage individually without any intervention.&#x20;

The framework handles integration listing, authentication, and configuration "out of the box", built on a scalable serverless architecture with a growing library of prebuilt API modules to greatly reduce time to wow. Along with the core "out of the box" features, the framework contains primitives to help address and flex to any use case. Here's a quick list:

* Eventing
  * Webhooks/Callbacks
  * Scheduled/Polling
  * User initiated
* Syncing
  * Bi-directional
  * Field-level selection
* Easy Route Creation
* Internal facing APIs
* External facing APIs
* Queues
* Associations

Basic Architecture

A Frigg Application is predominantly a backend microservice, with an optional frontend. Most folks who adopt Frigg already have their frontend UI either built out in their framework of choice, or designed to be baked into their core code. We've built a simple library of components for you to use to get started quickly. See more details about frontend options here.

In the backend, Frigg is based on the serverless.com framework. This key piece of technology and the underlying compute/architecture under the hood provides a number of advantages:

* Infrastructure-as-Code- The need to manually configure resources on the host provider is greatly reduced
* Deployable to your favorite host- AWS, GCP, Azure, any a list of many more are available
* Horizontal Scalability
* Pay as you go
