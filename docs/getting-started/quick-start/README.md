# Quick Start Tutorial

### Getting Started

Aloha! Letâ€™s test out running Frigg locally by cloning and installing a quick start template app.&#x20;

### Prerequisites

You'll need to do the following before continuing:

* Make sure you have [node and npm installed](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)
* Create a free hosted MongoDB cluster through [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database) OR [install MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/installation/) locally
  * You'll need to create a db admin user and you'll want your connection string.

### Overview

Create Frigg App will generate a deployable Frigg application that within a few minutes can be deployed to your own accounts to power integrations for your application. Let's get it going and we'll unpack the "magic" as we go.
