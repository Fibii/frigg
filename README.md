# Frigg Integration Framework

<img src="docs/FriggLogo.svg">

**Frigg** is a **Framework** that powers **Universal Integrations** between your app and external software partners.

Build enterprise-grade integrations as simply as _`create-frigg-app`_.

## About the Frigg Framework

Frigg is a tool to build dynamic and simple integrations between your software and your partners, without the trouble of setting up expensive and complex servers to accomplish the task.

Integrate your apps professionally, using modern serverless solutions, with an enterpise-class bag of tricks.

<a href="https://lefthook.com/">Left Hook</a> is an integrations software and services organization, and we created Frigg because we were sick of recreating the wheel every time we started a project. We made it open source, because we figured you were sick of it, too.

## What does Frigg mean?

Frigg (Frig, Frigga, Frija) was one of the mightiest gods in the Norse pantheon, as well as a Germaic Æsir. Her name comes from the proto-germanic word Frijjō, meaning 'Beloved' or 'Free'.

We chose her as the patron of this project for her connection to love, her support of marriage and unions, and to honor those deep private conversations that take place between your integration partners that are no one else's business.

Frigg was the Queen of Asgard and the highest of the goddesses. She and Her husband, Odin ruled the other gods of Olympus.
